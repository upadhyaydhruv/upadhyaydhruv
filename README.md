I'm Dhruv, a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and recipient of the Schulich Leader Scholarship, the most coveted STEM scholarship in Canada. I am passionate about emerging technologies in the field of aviation and robotics.

Currently, I'm an embedded systems developer at the University of Waterloo Robotics Team and the Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group, where I develop firmware for a Mars Rover and autonomous UAV respectively. In the past, I've worked as a Software Developer Intern at Automated Visualization (AuVis), a SaaS startup developing commercial data visuializtion dashboards. I have also conducted bioinformatics research, and participated in engineering clubs such as FIRST and Skills Robotics, where I was the Team Captain.

Some of my hobbies including flying (I'm a licensed glider pilot), hiking, and reading books. I'm always open to new opportunities and possible internships in the fields of embedded systems, electrical engineering, and robotics, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me, I look forward to connecting!
