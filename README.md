I'm Dhruv, incoming mechatronics engineering candidate at the University of Waterloo, and recipient of the Schulich Leader Scholarship, the most coveted STEM scholarship in Canada. I am passionate about emerging technologies, the environment, and entrepreneurship.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer Intern at Automated Visualization, and as a youth delegate at the Region of Durham's Environmental Advisory Committee. In the past, I have participated in a variety of extracurriculars, dabbled my foot into social entrepreneurship, conducted bioinformatics research, and ran campaigns for environmental awareness.

Some of my hobbies including flying (I'm a licensed glider pilot), hiking, and reading books. I'm always open to new opportunities and possible internships, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me, I look forward to connecting!
